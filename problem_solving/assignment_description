3. Data Encryption System: Rahul wants to send encoded messages to his friend Ram. Develop an algorithm to encode all the digits,
 special characters, lower and upper case alphabets.


problem identification:
	to encrypt the given message

problem decomposition:
	1.find the contents of the message
	2.encrypt the message

pattern recognisation:
	find a character and assigning the huffman code to it.

abstraction
	dosent concentrate on length of the message



Algorithm:
step1:start
step2:take the input message to encrypt
step3:find the frequencies of each characters
step4:find the huffman tree for these characters using these frequencies
step5:from this huffman tree find the huffman codes for each character
step6:now find the encrypted message by replacing each character with its haffman code
step7:stop



time complexity:

we will extract minimum values for 2(n-1) times.
and to extract one minimum value it takes O(logn)
so the total time complexity is O(nlogn)
